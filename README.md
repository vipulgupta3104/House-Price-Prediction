## 📌 Project Overview

- Built a regression-based ML model to predict housing prices using Scikit-learn.
- Performed extensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering** to prepare the dataset.
- Applied various preprocessing techniques including encoding, handling null values, and scaling.
- Optimized model performance using **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Deployed and tested the model in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Features

- Predicts housing prices based on features like:
  - Size of the house
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Location
  - Other key attributes
- Visualization of trends and data distributions
- Cleaned and processed data using standard pipelines
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset contains around **20,000 entries** with multiple features.
- Columns include area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and price.

## 📈 Results

- Model performance evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
