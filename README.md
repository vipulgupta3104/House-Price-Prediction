●	Built and deployed a hyper-parameter tuned Machine Learning model in jupyter notebook using RandomForest algorithm that predicts the house prices based on features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location etc. 

●	Performed EDA and feature engineering on a housing dataset present on Kaggle which contains 20k houses by visualizing and encoding the data required using scikit learn library.
